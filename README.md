System call bodhi

The fstat() system call in Bodhi OS retrieves metadata about an open file using its file descriptor. It provides information such as file size, permissions, and modification time without requiring a path lookup. This improves efficiency in file handling and enhances security by validating access rights. fstat() helps optimize system performance by streamlining file operations.
